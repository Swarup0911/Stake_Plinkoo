# **Stake Plinko Game Recreation**
This repository contains a web-based recreation of the popular Plinko game found on platforms like Stake.com. It aims to simulate the core mechanics and user experience of the original game, allowing users to drop a ball down a pegged pyramid and watch it bounce into various prize slots.

## âœ¨ Features
**Dynamic Plinko Board**: A visually engaging pyramid board with pegs that guide the ball's trajectory.

**Adjustable Risk Levels**: Choose between different risk settings (e.g., Low, Medium, High) that influence the payout multipliers at the bottom of the board.

**Configurable Rows**: Customize the number of rows on the Plinko board, altering the complexity and potential outcomes of each drop.

**Manual Play**: Drop individual balls and observe their paths.

**Auto Play Mode**: Set up automated drops for continuous gameplay.

**Payout Display**: Clearly shows the multiplier achieved and the resulting win.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play
Set your Stake: Adjust the amount you wish to wager per drop.

Choose Risk Level: Select "Low," "Medium," or "High" to influence the distribution of multipliers. Higher risk typically means higher potential payouts on the edges but also more chances of lower payouts in the center.

Select Rows: Adjust the number of rows on the board. More rows mean a longer, more unpredictable path for the ball.

Drop the Ball: Click the "Play" button to release a ball from the top of the pyramid. Watch it bounce off the pegs.

Collect Payout: The ball will land in a slot at the bottom, and your winnings will be calculated based on the multiplier of that slot.
